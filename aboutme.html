    <p>Hello my name is Cole Vickery. 
    I am from Viera, Florida and this is my second semester at BYUI. 
    I'm currently studying computer science. 
    The thing I love most about this school is the people. 
    </p>
    <p2>
    I've met some of my best friends out here and we've had a lot of fun hanging out together. 
    I also plan to graduate with a bachelors. I'm taking this course as a part of my major.
    The information I learn from this is helpful because it allows me to learn to code and
    it allows me to make websites for myself and others.
    </p2>
